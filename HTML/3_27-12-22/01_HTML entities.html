    <p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of <b><i>SGML</i></b>. It was formally defined as such by the
        Internet Engineering Task Force<a href="">(IETF)</a> with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an
        HTML
        specification, the <u>"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)"</u> Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly,
        which
        included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.<a href=""><sup>[9][10]</sup> </a>The draft
        expired after six months, but
        was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images,
        reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's
        competing Internet-Draft, "<code>HTML</code>+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested
        standardizing
        already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]</p>
