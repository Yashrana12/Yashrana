    <p>In July 2012, WHATWG and<b><em> W3C</b></em>decided on a degree of separation.<mark> W3C will continue the HTML5
            specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by
            WHATWG.</mark> The
        WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard".<u><ins> The concept of a living
                standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved.</ins></u> New features
        can be added but functionality will not be removed.<sup>[51]</sup>
        In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.<sup>[52]</sup> <kbd>The criterion for
            advancement to
            W3C Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".</kbd><sup>[53]</sup></p>
