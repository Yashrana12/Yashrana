    <p> <abbr title="">HTML</abbr>elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.with HTML constructs, images and other
        objects such as interactive forms may be embeded into the rendered page.<br>HTML provides a means to create
        structured semantics for text such as <em><strong>headings, paragraph, lists, links, quotes and other
                items</strong></em>.<br>HTML elements are delinated by tag, written using<u>angle brackets</u>.tags such
        as &lt;img/&gt; and &lt;inputs/&gt; directly introduce content into the page.other tag such as &lt;p&gt;
        surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.browsers do not
        display the HTMLtags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
